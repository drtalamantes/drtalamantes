### Hey, I'm Danika 👋
![My Image](Github-banner.png)
I started programming at a young age and pursued Computer Information Technology in college. Even with all of this time and experience, I still feel fairly new to the computer programming space, even after creating multiple web designs from scratch using Wordpress. Some things I love to say I'm great at include content creation, edtech, and traveling the world while eating food! I never took my passions seriously until now; and I'm ready to follow wherever the wind takes me.

👩‍💻 I'm currently working on improving my computer programming skills
<br>🧠 I'm currently learning the mindset and habits of a computer programmer
